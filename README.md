## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up & running.

```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`).

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing the project further:

```shell
yarn dev
```

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:

```shell
yarn build
```

### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
git push
```

After that Storybook will be deployed to GitHub pages and app to Vercel.
